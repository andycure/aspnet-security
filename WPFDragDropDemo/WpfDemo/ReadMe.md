# WPF DataGrid Drag & Drop Effect

This project is about demonstrating the drag & drop effect which you can achieve with simple wpf datagrid. There are two demonstrating effect which has been done here:

### 1. Show the selected rows while dragging
selected rows are shown in a popup while dragging over. This is achieved by adding a popup and following steps:
i. A container control to show data (selected rows). A DataGrid here.
ii. A popup which holds the container control.
iii. On Row_DragOver event binding the container control and displaying the popup on current mouse position and otherwise hide the popup.

### 2. Show the row indicator line for drop location
drop location is indicated with a blue highligted line which tells where exactly the selectes rows will be placed.To achieve this we need to figure out the drop location based on our data collection index position and then dynamically apply the styling to draw a Row Indicator line and this is achieved by:
Â i. Creating an enum RowEffect which will help to hold the info for drag position.
 ii. Adding the in Person model.
 iii. Based on the datagrid's data collection change(i.e remove item and then add the dragged back at respective index), setting the value of RowEffect for Person model On Row_DragOver event.
 iv. Finally Overridding the DataGrid.RowStyle and change the style of the target row's border based on your Person.RowEffect value.

**Note:** This is a prototype to help you on how to achieve the effect so you have to do your own customization or work to achieve what you need, if you need to.
